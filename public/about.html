    <h2>Life Re-evaluation</h2>
    <p>Waking up one day and realizing that your life has fallen into a deep rut can be quite a shock. Most of the time, I would have attributed it to something I ate or just waking up on the wrong side of the bed, but this felt like an urgent call. I decided to take stock and find out the source of my feeling.</p>

    <h2>And now for something completely different . . .</h2>
    <p>I have decided to change careers. I have been a doctor since 1996 and practicing ER medicine for most of that time. I am a 4th generation doctor and my life trajectory has been a fairly straight line. I have not felt completely fulfilled although I did enjoy helping lots of people. If the goal is to find purpose in life, I felt like I had to strike out on a new path and accept the challenge that comes with dealing with the unknown.</p>

    <h2>Tech career?</h2>
    <p>In searching for a new life path, I went back to something from my childhood. I loved to program when a preteen and was excited by new technology. I grew up in the early era of computers - my first programing experience was on a TRS-80. My first personal computer was a timex-sinclair (fully tricked out with 16K memory expansion, external keyboard, a cassette tape as a storage medium, and a thermal printer). I then graduated to the short lived Intelevision computer (the intelevision game system docked into the computer and it had a built in cassette drive). I did my first large program on this: the Cassette Operating System (creating a DOS type environment to emmulate a floppy disk retrival and organisation system with the cassette drive). My best friend (and fellow programmer) and I were approached by Borderbound software to develop an educational program (written in Basic) to instruct high school students on how computers work (at the circuit level). Unfortunately, the funding dried up and the program was ended and so was my computer career. I then entered high school and focused on doing medical research in my summers.</p>

    <h2>Transitions</h2>
    <p>Hoping to transform into a butterfly, I am hoping to enter the crysalis of a Web development boot camp. This intense experience is just what I need to jump the track and get out of the well worn groove my life has settled into. In preparing for this I am trying to learn code on my own and building websites and even blogs :)</p>
